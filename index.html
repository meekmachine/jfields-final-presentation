                <p>Motivation</p>
                <p><small>The goal of the project is to explore and demonstrate the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing the emotional intelligence of virtual agents. This is vital for improving the interaction between humans and machines, especially in roles that require empathy and understanding, such as customer service and healthcare.</small></p>

                <h2>Inspiration from Facial Inferencing Study</h2>
                <p>Our study is inspired by recent research that examines the inference of Big Five personality traits from facial expressions. <br>

                <h2>Background Study Methodology</h2>
                <p>The referenced study utilized an online survey where participants rated faces on personality traits using a set of adjectives, providing a robust framework for our methodology.</p>

                <h2>Big Five Personality Traits and Mini-Markers</h2>
                <p>The Big Five personality traits—Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability—are assessed using Mini-Markers. <strong>Examples:</strong> "Talkative" for Extraversion, "Sympathetic" for Agreeableness.</p>

                <h2>Adapting Methodology for e-Eva</h2>
                <p>We will use a similar online platform where participants assess generated facial expressions of the e-Eva agent. The focus will be on capturing perceptions of the Big Five traits using the same adjective-based assessment method.</p>

                <h2>Experimental Design for e-Eva Study</h2>
                <p>Our experiment will mimic the structure of the original study, using Mechanical Turk for participant recruitment, pending IRB approval. Initial testing will utilize classmates and family members. Participants will evaluate a series of generated facial expressions and use specific verbs and adjectives to rate each based on perceived personality traits.</p>

                <h2>Sample Likert Scale Questions</h2>
                <p>The following sample questions will be included in our surveys to assess the perceived personality traits of the e-Eva agent's facial expressions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The person appears to be talkative." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be reliable." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be outgoing." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be compassionate." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be calm." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
