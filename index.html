                <h1>Savoir-Faire Quiz</h1>
                <p>Motivation</p>
                <p><small>The goal of the project is to explore and demonstrate the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing the emotional intelligence of virtual agents. This is vital for improving the interaction between humans and machines, especially in roles that require empathy and understanding, such as customer service and healthcare.</small></p>

                <h2>Inspiration from Facial Inferencing Study</h2>
                <p>The Savoir-Faire Quiz is inspired by recent research that examines the inference of Big Five personality traits from facial expressions. <br>

                <h2>Big Five Personality Traits and Mini-Markers</h2>
                <p>The Big Five personality traits—Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability—are assessed using Mini-Markers. <strong>Examples:</strong> "Talkative" for Extraversion, "Sympathetic" for Agreeableness.</p>

                <h2>The Role of Emotional Labels</h2>
                <p>The study examines how different emotional labels applied to the same facial expression can alter perception. This addresses a key question: Do facial expressions or the labels we attach to them have a greater influence on our interpretation of others' emotions?</p>

                <h2>Adapting Methodology for e-Eva</h2>
                <p>We will use a similar online platform where participants assess generated facial expressions of the e-Eva agent. The focus will be on capturing perceptions of the Big Five traits using the same adjective-based assessment method.</p>

                <h2>Research Questions</h2>
                <p>The primary research questions for the Savoir-Faire Quiz are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can participants accurately infer personality traits from facial expressions of the e-Eva agent?</li>
                    <li>How do participants rate the e-Eva agent on the Big Five personality traits?</li>
                    <li>What are the implications of these ratings for the design and development of emotionally intelligent virtual agents?</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Experimental Design for e-Eva Study</h2>
                <p>Our experiment will mimic the structure of the original study, using Mechanical Turk for participant recruitment, pending IRB approval. Initial testing will utilize classmates and family members. Participants will evaluate a series of generated facial expressions and use specific verbs and adjectives to rate each based on perceived personality traits.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Emotional Stability vs. Neuroticism</h2>
                <p>When assessing personality traits, we often encounter the spectrum of Emotional Stability and Neuroticism. These terms describe a continuum where one end signifies resilience and calmness, and the other signifies sensitivity to stress.</p>
                <p>In our study, we have chosen to use the term <strong>Emotional Stability</strong> rather than Neuroticism. This decision is based on several considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Positive Framing:</strong> "Emotional Stability" carries a more positive connotation compared to "Neuroticism," which can be perceived negatively. Positive framing helps in reducing any bias that might arise from the participants' negative associations with the words used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reducing Bias:</strong> By focusing on stability, we encourage participants to think about the presence of calm and composed traits rather than the absence or presence of stress or anxiety, which can influence their responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhancing Comfort:</strong> Discussing stability instead of neuroticism may make participants feel more comfortable during the study, ensuring that their responses are more natural and less influenced by any stigma associated with mental health.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These considerations are crucial for ensuring that our study accurately assesses how facial expressions are perceived in terms of personality traits without introducing unnecessary bias or negative perceptions.</p>

                <h2>Sample Prompts for Generating Facial Expressions</h2>
                <p>Our study utilizes a series of specifically crafted prompts to generate facial expressions using a Language Model. These expressions aim to reflect distinct personality traits from the Big Five. Here's a look at our sample prompts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Openness:</strong> "Generate an expression of someone who appears open to new experiences and shows a high level of imagination."</li>
                    <li><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> "Generate an expression of someone who appears extremely meticulous and organized."</li>
                    <li><strong>Extraversion:</strong> "Generate an expression of someone who looks highly sociable and energetic."</li>
                    <li><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> "Generate an expression of someone who looks exceedingly warm and empathetic."</li>
                    <li><strong>Emotional Stability:</strong> "Generate an expression of someone who looks calm and emotionally stable."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These prompts are used to guide the model in creating facial expressions that participants will then evaluate, helping us understand how personality traits are perceived based on facial cues alone.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Sample Likert Scale Questions</h2>
                <p>The following sample questions will be included in our surveys to assess the perceived personality traits of the e-Eva agent's facial expressions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The person appears to be talkative." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be reliable." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be outgoing." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be compassionate." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
                    <li>"The person appears to be calm." <br><strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> - <strong>Strongly Agree</strong></li>
